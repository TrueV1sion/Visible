### ❌ **Critical Gaps & Issues**

**Architecture Problems:**
1. **Conflicting Backend Structures**: Both `backend/app/` and `ai_orchestration/src/` exist
2. **Missing Database Integration**: Models defined but not properly connected
3. **Incomplete AI Pipeline**: Agents exist but orchestration is fragmented
4. **No Production Configuration**: Missing environment-specific configs

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Incomplete Authentication**: Missing refresh token implementation
2. **No Input Sanitization**: External data not properly validated
3. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse
4. **Weak Error Handling**: Sensitive information may leak in errors

**Performance Issues:**
1. **No Caching Layer**: AI responses not cached (expensive operations)
2. **Synchronous Processing**: AI generation blocks requests
3. **Missing Connection Pooling**: Database connections not optimized
4. **No Request Queuing**: High load will overwhelm the system

**Missing Core Features:**
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket implementation absent
2. **File Upload/Management**: No document processing capabilities
3. **Export Functionality**: Can't export battlecards to PDF/Word
4. **Audit Logging**: No user action tracking

### 🔧 **Technical Debt**

**Code Quality:**
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing type annotations in Python code
- Duplicate code across AI agents
- No comprehensive test coverage
- Missing API documentation

**Infrastructure:**
- No CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Missing monitoring and alerting setup
- No backup and disaster recovery plan
- Incomplete logging and observability
